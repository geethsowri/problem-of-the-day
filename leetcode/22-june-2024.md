## GFG POTD - 22nd June 2024 - Extract the Number from the String

### `Question`
Given a sentence containing several words and numbers. Find the largest number among them which does not contain 9. If no such number exists, return -1. <br>
Note: Numbers and words are separated by spaces only. It is guaranteed that there are no leading zeroes in the answer.
### `Approach`
- **Split the Sentence:** Use a stringstream to split the input sentence into individual words and numbers.
- **Filter Numbers:** Identify parts that are numbers.
- **Check for Digit '9':** Among the identified numbers, filter out those that contain the digit '9'.
- **Find the Maximum:** Among the filtered numbers (that do not contain the digit '9'), find the largest one.
- **Edge Cases:** If no numbers remain after filtering, return -1.
### `Code (C++ / Python)`
```c++ 
class Solution {
  public:
    long long ExtractNumber(string sentence) {
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string temp;
        vector<string> v;
        while(ss>>temp){
          v.push_back(temp);  
        }
        vector<long long> res;
        for(int i=0; i<v.size(); i++){
            if(all_of(v[i].begin(), v[i].end(), ::isdigit)){
                if(v[i].find('9')==string::npos) res.push_back(stoll(v[i]));
            }
        }
        if(!res.size()) return -1;
        else {
            sort(res.begin(), res.end());
            return res[res.size()-1];
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def ExtractNumber(self,sentence):
        words = sentence.split()

        valid_numbers = []

        for word in words:
            if word.isdigit():
                if '9' not in word:
                    valid_numbers.append(int(word))
        if not valid_numbers:
            return -1
        return max(valid_numbers)
```
