## LEETCODE POTD - 23nd June 2024 - Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit [1438]

### `Question`
Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.
### `Approach`
- **Deques for Tracking Min and Max:** 
  - Use two deques: increase to keep track of the increasing order of elements (for the minimum value) and decrease for the decreasing order of elements (for the maximum value).
- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - Iterate through the array while maintaining a sliding window.
  - For each element, add it to both deques:
    - Remove elements from the back of increase deque until the last element is greater than the current element.
    - Remove elements from the back of decrease deque until the last element is less than the current element.
  - Add the current element to the back of both deques.
- **Adjust Window:**

  - Check the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the current window (front elements of the decrease and increase deques respectively).
  - If the difference exceeds the limit, adjust the window by moving the left pointer until the difference is within the limit again.
  - Remove elements from the deques if they are equal to the element at the left pointer before incrementing the left pointer.
- **Track Maximum Size:**
  - Calculate the size of the current valid window and update the maximum size if the current size is larger.
### `Code (C++ / Python)`
```c++ 
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        deque<int> increase;
        deque<int> decrease;
        int max_len = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            while (!increase.empty() && nums[right] < increase.back()) {
                increase.pop_back();
            }
            increase.push_back(nums[right]);

            while (!decrease.empty() && nums[right] > decrease.back()) {
                decrease.pop_back();
            }
            decrease.push_back(nums[right]);

            while (decrease.front() - increase.front() > limit) {
                if (nums[left] == decrease.front()) {
                    decrease.pop_front();
                }
                if (nums[left] == increase.front()) {
                    increase.pop_front();
                }
                ++left;
            }

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1);
        }

        return max_len;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestSubarray(self, nums, limit):
        increase = deque()
        decrease = deque()
        max_length = 0
        left = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            while increase and nums[right] < increase[-1]:
                increase.pop()
            increase.append(nums[right])
            
            while decrease and nums[right] > decrease[-1]:
                decrease.pop()
            decrease.append(nums[right])
            
            while decrease[0] - increase[0] > limit:
                if nums[left] == increase[0]:
                    increase.popleft()
                if nums[left] == decrease[0]:
                    decrease.popleft()
                left += 1
                
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_length
```
