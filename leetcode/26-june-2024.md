# LEETCODE POTD - 25nd June 2024 - Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum [1038]

## `Question`
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST. <br>

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints: <br>

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. <br>
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. <br>
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
## `Approach`
- Inorder Traversal: We perform an inorder traversal of the given BST and store the nodes in a sorted array sortedArr.
- Constructing Balanced BST: We then use the sorted array to construct a new, balanced BST. We do this by recursively building the tree from the middle element as the root, and the left and right subarrays as the left and right subtrees.
## `Time Complexity`
- The time complexity of this code is O(n)
## `Code (C++)`
```c++ 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> sortedArr;
    TreeNode* balanceBST(TreeNode* root) {
        inorderTraverse(root);
        return sortedArrayToBST(0, sortedArr.size() - 1);
    }
    void inorderTraverse(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return;
        inorderTraverse(root->left);
        sortedArr.push_back(root);
        inorderTraverse(root->right);
    }
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) return NULL;
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        TreeNode* root = sortedArr[mid];
        root->left = sortedArrayToBST(start, mid - 1);
        root->right = sortedArrayToBST(mid + 1, end);
        return root;
    }
};
```
