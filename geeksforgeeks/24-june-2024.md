# GFG POTD - 24nd June 2024 - Summed Matrix

## `Question`
A matrix is constructed of size n*n and given an integer `q`. The value at every cell of the matrix is given as, `M(i,j) = i+j`, where `M(i,j)` is the value of a cell, `i` is the row number, and `j` is the column number. Return the number of cells having value `q`.
<br> Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.
## `Approach`
- Initialization:
  - The variable ans is initialized to 0.
- Check if q equals 𝑛 :
  - If **q** equals **n**, the function sets `ans` to **n-1** because the possible pairs `(i,j)` such that `i + j = n` will be `(1, n-1), (2, n-2), ..., (n-1, 1)`.
- Check if **q** is greater than **n**:
  - If **q** is greater than **n**:
    - The function checks if `2n - q + 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
    - If true, it sets `ans` to `2n - q + 1`. This represents the valid pairs `(i,j)` such that `i + j = q` within the bounds of the matrix.
    - Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 0 as there are no valid pairs `(i,j)` in the matrix.

- Else case where **q** is less than **n**:
    - If **q** is less than **n**, the function sets `ans` to **q-1** because the possible pairs `(i,j)` such that `i + j = q` will be `(1, q-1), (2, q-2), ..., (q-1, 1)`.
- Return the result:
  - Finally, the function returns the value of ans.
- Time Complexity
    - Time Complexity: O(1) (constant time)
## `Code (C++)`
```c++ 
class Solution {
  public:
    long long sumMatrix(long long n, long long q) {
        long long ans = 0;
        if(q == n) 
            ans = n - 1;
        else if(q > n) 
            if((2*n - q + 1) >= 0) 
                ans = 2*n - q + 1;
            else 
                ans = 0;
        else 
            ans = q - 1;
        return ans;
    }
};
```
