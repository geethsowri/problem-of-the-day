## GFG POTD - 23nd June 2024 - Print Bracket Number

### `Question`
Given a string str, the task is to find the bracket numbers, i.e., for each bracket in str, return i if the bracket is the ith opening or closing bracket to appear in the string. 
### `Approach`
- Initialization:
    - ans: A vector to store the resulting bracket numbers.
    - st: A stack to keep track of the numbers assigned to the opening brackets.
    - cnt: A counter initialized to 0, used to assign sequential numbers to the opening brackets.
- Iterating through the string:
     - For each character c in the string str:
        - If c is an opening bracket '(':
            - Increment the counter cnt.
            - Push the current value of cnt onto the stack st.
            - Append the current value of cnt to the result vector ans.
        - If c is a closing bracket ')':
            - Append the value at the top of the stack st to the result vector ans.
            - Pop the top value from the stack st.
- Returning the result:
    - After iterating through the entire string, the vector ans will contain the bracket numbers, which is then returned.
### `Code (C++)`
```c++ 
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> bracketNumbers(string str) {
        vector<int> ans;
        stack <int> st;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for(char c : str) {
            
            if(c == '(') {
                cnt++;
                st.push(cnt);
                ans.push_back(cnt);
            } else if(c == ')') {
                ans.push_back(st.top());
                st.pop();
            }
        } 
        return ans;
    }
};
```
